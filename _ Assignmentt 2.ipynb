    "   Example (using a `while` loop):\n",

    "   i = 0\n",

    "   - The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop when a specific condition is met, but it does not exit the entire loop.\n",

    "In a `for` loop in Python, there is no practical difference between `range(10)`, `range(0, 10)`, and `range(0, 10, 1)`. All three of these expressions produce the same sequence of numbers, and you can use any of them interchangeably. Here's an explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`range(10)`**:\n",
    "   - This expression creates a sequence of numbers from 0 up to, but not including, 10.\n",
    "   - It's a shorthand notation for specifying the start and end values of the range.\n",
    "   - By default, it starts at 0 and ends at the specified value (10 in this case) with a step of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   for i in range(10):\n",
    "       print(i)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`range(0, 10)`**:\n",
    "   - This expression explicitly specifies both the start and end values of the range.\n",
    "   - It creates the same sequence as `range(10)`, starting at 0 and ending at 10 (not inclusive) with a step of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "  \n",
    "   for i in range(0, 10):\n",
    "       print(i)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`range(0, 10, 1)`**:\n",
    "   - This expression explicitly specifies the start, end, and step values of the range.\n",
    "   - It creates the same sequence as the previous two examples, starting at 0 and ending at 10 (not inclusive) with a step of 1.\n",
    "   - Specifying a step of 1 is redundant because it's the default step value for `range()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   for i in range(0, 10, 1):\n",
    "       print(i)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "All three of these expressions are equivalent and will produce the numbers 0 through 9 in the `for` loop. You can choose the one that you find most readable or clear in your code, but it's common to use the simpler `range(10)` when the default start and step values are suitable for your needs."
